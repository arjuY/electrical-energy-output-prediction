# Net Electrical Energy Output Prediction
Problem statement: Predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP)  of a combined cycle power plant (CCPP) using hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V)  as features

# Dataset
The <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/294/combined+cycle+power+plant">Combined Cycle Power Plant</a> dataset encompasses 9568 data points spanning a six-year period from 2006 to 2011, during which a Combined Cycle Power Plant operated at full load. It includes essential features such as hourly average ambient variables like Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), and Exhaust Vacuum (V). These variables serve as inputs to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) generated by the plant. A Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) is a sophisticated system that integrates gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST), and heat recovery steam generators. In this setup, electricity generation occurs through the interplay of gas and steam turbines, working in a coordinated cycle where energy is efficiently transferred between the two. While Vacuum levels are closely related to the Steam Turbine, the remaining ambient variables significantly influence the performance of the Gas Turbine, collectively forming a comprehensive dataset for energy prediction in this industrial context.

# Model
The problem as seen above is clearly a regression task therefore we employ traditional machine learning regression algorithms and compare their performance on the dataset using an evaluation metric. The machine learning algorithms used in this project are given below:
1. Multiple linear regression
2. Polynomial regression
3. Support vector regression
4. Decision Tree Regression
5. Random Forest Regression

# Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric used in this project is $R^2$  (coefficient of determination) regression score. It is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

# Result
Random Forest Regression achieves the highest $R^2$ score of 0.962.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
